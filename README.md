# saic-test-2021
Submission for core team selection, Sys. Admin &amp; Infosec club, IIT Mandi

Each of the 4 tasks has a `readme.md` file in its folder. I tried to be as exhaustive with the descriptions as i could (as requested !). All the other files involved are also present in the folders.

*Note* : I was working on MacOS, so most of the shell/terminal commands are the ones available on Unix/Linux (and shell script is bash). I guess that there would be equivalents for windows also.
